          We've come to reunite once again, bringing messages about past,
          present and future with you. After a long unannounced content hiatus,
          the Wandering Makers will now resume activity on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          This letter is inteded to answer many questions regarding the events
          and changes that occurred.

          WHAT WENT DOWN AT WANDERING TOWN?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Activity on the Wandering Makers account slowly ground down to a halt,
          as a result of waning inspiration from the Makers themselves. Our work
          eficiency had been reduced since the beginning of the year, and
          reached a near-zero state for the latest 3 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we took advantage of this "break" to sharpen our skills as
          Makers, recover our inspirations, and set down important plans.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Recently, we took to reorganizing what we already had planned to share
          and create even more stuff. Regarding our work ethic, we've decided on
          a new "concepts-over-lore" style with subsequent work, and so we
          intend to have a less linear approach on posting chapter content
          moving forward - any order of chapter within our posts is fair game.
        </p>
        <p className="self-start">
          Keep reading to know more about all the details we can share.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-pixel-bold text-deltarune-yellow md:text-3xl sm:text-xl text-center mb-6">
          WHAT'S UP WITH CHAPTER 3?
        </h2>
        <img src="/assets/jun2023/TemCats.png" alt="A screenshot of Toby saying he put so many dogs in Undertale because Temmie liked dogs. Temmie answers saying she likes cats more now."/>
        <p className="self-start">Hmm.</p>
        <p>
          Funny stuff aside, we have done a few things for our Chapter 3, and
          made up a good idea for how it should go.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, recently, we have thus begun focusing more on the next
          chapters. For Chapter 3, expect fewer explosive bundles of content, so
          that we have a balanced amount of explosion material with all
          chapters.

          AND WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT CHAPTERS?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We're currently laying out out the groundwork for our Chapter 4.
          Despite the wacky adventures involving Kris, toriel, Mike and tenna,
          we had to also think about all the stuff that happens next.
        </p>
        <p>
          We plan to show the many new faces we've created soon. In the
          meantime, although we do not have any visuals, we do have{' '}

          Carrying our newfound knowledge, skill and motivation on our
          shoulders, we intend to post more frequently, as well as finish up the
          works we had started before the break.

          As of late, we' on the lookout for more Makers to help us bring this
          project to fruition. If you, the intent reader, are willing to give us
          a hand, do not hesitate to reach out to the Wandering Makers' Twitter
          account. There is an application form coming very soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have much more to pull from beneath the darkness, and we will bring
          it all into the light. Thank you for seeing what we have created so
          far.
