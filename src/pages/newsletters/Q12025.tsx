          <p>
            Now that our showcase server is open to the public in Discord, we
            intend to share much more about our project, as has been the goal
            all along with our surge into{' '}

            jumped into bigger, more strewn-out posts about the shadowbosses.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the posts came along, we realized that preparing elaborate posts
            fit for this type of platform would redirect precious focus &
            efforts away from the real project. With Discord as a more casual
            channel for communication, we can send out things at a higher
            variety (and less context) than before - like this, for instance:

          <p>
            Of course, this increases the possibility that we post content that
            may have been or futurely be scrapped and discarded - but that's
            just gonna be part of the charm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe we could even call it the Server of the Discarded… or not,
            since that would imply the members inside are all discarded, rather
            than the content. They're just poor souls waiting to see discarded
            characters and explore discarded areas in a game we very much hope
            isn't gonna be discarded in the future.

            produced in the{' '}

              KRISTAL Engine
            </a>
            , and it follows a scenario in which the Fun Gang (or most of it)
            finds themselves in a world darker than dark itself, reaching into
            the vast expanse of different universes to fulfill an only purpose:
            collect SHADOW CRYSTALS from the mysterious dwellers unseen by their
            worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it picks up where the original DELTARUNE left off, and follows
            some basic foundations determined by our own prediction DELTARUNE ·
            WM, the game follows no traditional storyline, and stands firmly as
            a “What If” spin-off to both DELTARUNE, DELTARUNE · WM, and the
            framework that shapes the community's usual "chapter takes".
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our major focuses is to help our and our community's
            creations outlive the release of the official chapters of DELTARUNE.
            This means that the game will boast characters, in cameo or content,
            authored by other DELTARUNE fan-creators who collaborated with the
            team to bring their ideas to life!

          WHAT ABOUT THE PREVIOUS PREDICTION PROJECT?
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            To make things clear: We've turned our focus completely onto the
            Pantheon.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is to say, because several parts from that project will be
            featured in PotD, we still create things for the old take and keep
            the details in mind. Not to mention, a lot of the core assumptions
            about DELTARUNE will be extracted from DELTARUNE · WM, so it's quite
            unlikely that we will fully detach from it anytime soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, creating PotD also means creating for DELTARUNE · WM, in
            a sense. These two projects are deeply connected, after all…
          </p>

          <p className="text-center text-[14px] !-mt-4">by Lua</p>
          <p>
            Buuut, for the curious ones out there whose greatest wish is to know
            more about our original chapters, let's talk a little bit more about
            them right now!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our original project was born from throwaway theories about what
            awaits us in DELTARUNE, and, for a long time, that's what it was -
            we probably spent a good 1 whole year just thinking about them.
            Against all supposition, however, the truth is that we don't
            actually have that many things thought out and planned for the take
            as one would imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't get me wrong - we've done a LOT of stuff. A while back, one of
            our team members assembled all of our concept art so far into a
            little document and we got a pretty good notion of just how much we
            created. Roughly, all of our work counts up to a few hundreds(!!!)
            of artpieces, and the number just keeps growing! Not to mention all
            the spritework, the writing and the tons and tons of brainstorming…
          </p>
          <p>
            But alas, narrative-wise, the old prediction project is far from
            done, and we're also still looking out for opportunities to make
            extra visual & musical proofs-of-concept to share.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will say that the sheer amount of work done specifically for
            Pantheon of the Discarded has far succeeded that of work done for
            our chapter takes… but that's beside the point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be as it may, to keep you up to speed, we do have a good notion of
            our take's true story, in that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>All Chapter settings from 3 to 6 have been determined</li>
            <li>
              At least 3 shadowbosses (for up to 5) have been thought out (some
              more than others)
            </li>
            <li>
              The general plot, albeit in a state of constant metamorphosis, has
              a good direction
            </li>
            <li>
              The storyline of Chapter 3 has been set in stone, and the focal
              points of Chapters 4 and 5 are pretty firm.
            </li>
          </ul>

          DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Activity in the work environment has never been this high, and in
            kind, our disposition is equally bright!
          </p>
          <p>
            Much like the Chapter-based release system in the original
            DELTARUNE, we will release separated sections of PotD - which we
            will call “Waves” - each containing the next part of the game's
            story, new locations and challenges, and an array of 3-5 dedicated
            “Shadowboss” segments.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/q12025/silhouettes.png" alt='Three shadowy silhouettes'/>
          <p>
            Our first launch will be marked as a “DEMO” version, and contain the
            very first Wave, starting off the story with 3 original
            Shadowbosses. (Plus a familiar encounter you might've seen in the
            trailer…)
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to release this DEMO as a means to introduce the public, and
            a metric to our assessment of the fangame's development. From the
            second Wave onward, expect the appearance of all-new,
            community-sourced guest characters!!! (And also original characters)
          </p>
          <p>
            All of our development sectors are focused and flourishing - a
            little disproportionately across the board, but it's an expected
            part of the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, we're not sufficiently far into development to be able to
            give a completion percentage, much less a release date, for that
            matter. That said, everything's running smoothly, and we intend to
            keep expanding our team to better adequate to the true scope of this
            game.

            The Pantheon links itself to the many different universes out there,
            and gives way for our Fun Gang to HIJACK and INVADE them, for the
            purpose of ransacking their ever-so-desired SHADOW CRYSTALS.

          <p>
            Of course, that doesn't go without its own set of troubles - every

            Although, all the many different worlds and characters are only half
            of the Fun. The Pantheon itself is a bajillion times bigger and more
            expansive than any of the individual worlds, and ripe for
            exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every new Wave contains not JUST a slew of shadowbosses to
            encounter, but ALSO even more of the Pantheon! We hope you will
